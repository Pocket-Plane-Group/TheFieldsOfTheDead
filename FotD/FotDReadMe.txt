---------------
1. Introduction
---------------

The Fields of the Dead is a mod for Baldur's Gate - Tales of the Sword Coast which expands and renews the game. The AD&D rules have been updated as much as the Infinity Engine allows it, both to add more options to the things that have been simplified as well as introduce elements that have been left out. The basic stats of many creatures, items and spells have also been corrected.

The mod adds much new content to the game. There are new spells for both wizards and priests covering all spell levels, numerous magical and mundane items, and many new creatures, all of which are fully integrated into the game. Enemy NPCs make use of the new spells and items, stores carry the items and the new creatures can be found in the existing areas.

The AI has been updated throughout the game. NPCs co-orporate, use items like potions and scrolls, and have access to all the spells in the game instead of just a few spells. They use spells to protect and heal each other, and will no longer waste powerful spells on weak enemies such as summoned monsters.

Lastly, the mod adds a new area to the worldmap. This area may be explored at any time but is designed to provide a challenge for experienced parties.

4. Known Issues
---------------

Disabling the party AI prevents Chant, Strength of One and
Defensive Harmony from working. Of course, if you do not use any of these
spells, you can disable it. If you normally disable the party AI because
you want full control over the characters, instead remove the default script
they have been assigned and replace it with 'none'.

The world map icon for Battle of Bones does not match the icons in Tutu/BGT.

Certain contents exclusive to BG2 (creatures, classes, kits, half-orcs) have not been updated by FotD.

There is currently no BG:EE specific TRA.

The new spells are using icons from BG2.

 Move Boo to an inventory slot.
 Remove Edwin's amulet but keep the extra spells.

V2.00 BETA 1

-CHANGES:

This release is almost a recreation of the mod, moving from overwriting files to patching through WeiDU. It also abandons support for the original version of Baldur's Gate in favour of support for Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition, BG1Tutu and Baldur's Gate Trilogy. Naturally, it also contains a number of changes and lots of fixes, but more importantly, it represents a change of focus. When FotD was first released, it could be broken down into the following components: P&P-related Changes, New Content (also drawn from P&P), Improved AI and Echon's Arbitrary Changes. That last component mainly originated from my desire to renew the gameplay experience and discourage metagaming by relocating magical items and creatures, randomising treasure, and so on. Some changes, however, were simply based on personal preferences. During this update, I decided that while the first three components fit well together, the last one seems random and out of place. Consequently, most of these changes (especially related to areas) have been rolled back, and more of them are likely to follow. However, some of them will be reintroduced as optional components later on for those who would like to add more tweaks to their game.

Low-quality items have been removed
Racial shields have been removed
For some creatures, such as the wyvern, not every attack is poisonous
Spellcasters no longer lose dexterity bonuses to AC when casting spells (it was bugged)
