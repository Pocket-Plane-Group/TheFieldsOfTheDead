At a first glance, this sword appears much like any other. In the presence of any shapeshifting creature however, the blade becomes warm as its power stirs. Its namesake was the original owner of the weapon, and his tale, though mostly long forgotten, was wrought with treachery and deceit. Rumors persist that he paid a fearsome price for this blade, but with it he revealed the true identities of those that sought to betray him. Their names and crimes however, are long since lost to history.

@5=~These swords are usually referred to as doubled-edged swords, war swords, or military swords. In many cases, the long sword has a single-edged blade. There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture, and may vary within the same culture depending on the era. Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from 35 inches to 47 inches. In the latter case, the blade is known to take up 40 inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip. Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.

@7=~Long Sword +2: 'Varscona'
Blades of this type were long used by Sharran priests during the sacrificial rites of "Feast of the Moon" ceremonies. Legends say that, when she passed on, the remains of this sword's wielder were mummified and the blade was placed within her chest as a symbol of power. In the first stage of a long forgotten ritual, she was to have been exhumed in a season, born again in some new form.  Unfortunately, cult wars killed the few that knew of her existence; her tomb became a prison where she was forgotten, and there she developed a rage that bordered on insanity. Her grave was eventually found, but it was deserted and gave no indication of her whereabouts. Some venture to say that her anger was so concentrated, she became one with the very blade of her weapon. Regardless, after hundreds of years surrounded by constant hate, the sword harvested a power of its own. It is now exceedingly deadly in combat.

@10=~Short Sword +2: 'The Whistling Sword'
Amidst the plains of the Eastern Shaar there lived a small human blacksmith, whose nearly dwarven height did not do his soul justice. Though a skilled weaponsmith, his true gift was his ability to whistle a heartfelt song that could cause a grown man to cry like a newborn. Only a reclusive mage shared and enjoyed time with the diminutive man, however, as others could only see his small size as a source of amusement. Deaf to the smith's song because of their own prejudices, their ridicule slowly grew into cruel torment which eventually persuaded the light-hearted man to leave his home forever. Before he left he forged this weapon as a gift for his one friend, who also enchanted it during the making. Thus the blade sweetly whistles to its wielder when unsheathed. It was not long after that the mage also deserted the small town in disgust, taking the sword with him on his journeys.

@17=~The long, curved, single edged blade is characteristic of both the sabre and the scimitar, even though their origins lie in different part of Faerun. Where as the sabre was intended mainly for horsemen, mainly due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence. The "shamshir", as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point. The effect of this is that it is slightly slower but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat. This particular weapon has been enhanced magically to complement the skill of the wielder, providing more accurate, damaging attacks, a faster attack speed factor, and the ability to strike opponents that are immune to normal weapons.

This blade has traveled far since its forging on the shores of the Shining Sea, though documentation of its passage is sketchy because of the mundane nature of the item. Such weapons are considered commonplace among the rich elite of the far south, and are of little consequence to historians of the area. This attitude is incomprehensible to a citizen of the Sword Coast, where people routinely die for items of equal or lesser enchantment.

@19=~Long Sword +1, Flame Tongue: 'The Burning Earth'
There was a time before Neverwinter was warm and before the great Anauroch was dry... or so it is said. Few relics remain to prove such an age existed, and fewer still have an identifiable purpose. "The Burning Earth" seems straightforward enough - it burns a victim with magical fire, and a cryptic rune seems to suggest that the power comes from the ground itself, but whomever constructed it remains a mystery. It looks a perfectly serviceable weapon, but something in the balance or grip is... wrong. It strains the forearm a touch, and does not fit the hand just right. It doesn't seem to hurt a warrior's performance, aside from the nagging doubt that the blade was not made for him... or any other humanoid.

This is a legendary weapon of heroic proportions, especially among the far-northern tribes of barbarians. Champion after champion has wielded this blade against countless enemies, and the blood it has spilled could fill a small sea. History will not admit that such a blade could be forged and each consecutive owner seems to tie its origin to whatever creation myth they believe. The most grandiose of these tales is that of a great chieftain who sailed to the cliffs that supposedly bordered the world. There he reached into the void, and his will shaped the blade from nothing. Whatever the truth, in the right hands this sword is a fearsome thing.

@61=~Bala's Axe - Wizard Slayer:
Bala was a foul-tempered prince of a gully dwarf clan, which was enslaved by a cruel elven mage in Thesk. Though Bala managed to escape the more cowardly traits of his race he was even more filthy and obnoxious than the average gully dwarf. Sickened of his enslavement, Bala crept into the mage's lair and cracked the elf's skull open. Although rumor has it that it was the dwarf's stench that overcame the mage, it was, in fact, his enchanted axe that caused the elf's spells to fail. It is obvious from the poor workmanship that Bala himself crafted the axe. The mystery lies in where its power originates. After a lengthy career of mage-slaying, Bala died, never having revealed his secret to those who were willing to risk a lice infestation by approaching him. Some say that the axe was powered by Bala's intense hatred of wizards. The axe makes it difficult for spellcasters to successfully use their magic.

STATISTICS:

Damage: 1D8

@75=~Club +1, +3 vs. unnatural creatures: 'The Root of the Problem'
This enchanted club is said to have existed since the time of the fall of Netheril and the birth of the great Anauroch Desert. While the toll on civilization was great, the true victims of this age were nature's creatures, condemned to stand and watch as their homes decayed and died. As habitats receded, those that remained were invaded by displaced hordes of creatures, the more impatient of which marched on unspoiled land taking whatever they wished. This particular weapon is said to have come from a dryad's tree, a final gift to nature's cause from a woodland spirit that could not hold back the invaders of her land. Hers was a bittersweet pain, as her wood might not have suffered so if it had not been so strong and lush. Less respecting scholars have since bestowed the item's ironic name, though the humor is not appreciated among nature's more devout followers.

Even the hordes have their heroes, and while they are vilified in civilized company, their deeds are sometimes impressive nonetheless. Krotan was an exceptionally intelligent orc, as far as orcs go, who commanded an ever-shifting legion of ogres, orcs, hobgoblins, and other assorted beasties during the Year of the Lost Lady, 1241DR. It was in this year that a group of orc bandits allegedly kidnapped and killed a Tethyrian noblewoman, and the response from authorities was a genocidal slaughter of orcs throughout the south in her memory. Krotan mounted a defense that ensured his people were not entirely destroyed; though they were displaced. Krotan himself fell near the end of the conflict, and his head was mounted outside the graveyard where the young lady was buried. As a point of interest, orcs called this time the "Year of Pushing Too Far."

The Duke of Delthuntle, known only as Raymond, demanded a demonstration of Edwall's skill on a scarecrow that he had placed. Edwall Dest drew his longbow and released the arrow with determination, not stopping to think how uncannily the target resembled himself. The missile split the large voodoo doll's head in twain, and at that moment Edwall's head did much the same.

Needless to say, the hero who aided the grateful dryads lived happily... nay, VERY happily ever after!

Despite his aggressive nature, he was an honorable combatant and never slew opponents he could overpower. Suryris met his superior only once, in a battle that lasted hours and had the minotaur often fearing defeat. The contest ended when his opponent's sword broke, but Suryis knew he likely would have been bested had it continued. He presented his weapon to the astonished man, who thereafter told of this noble creature to anyone who would listen.

@208=~Greagan's Harp: 'The Captive Audience'
This finely made harp is well known among the nomadic peoples of the east, though more for the infamy of its owner, Greagan of the Low Hills. He was a bard, of sorts, though less for his love of people than his hatred of hard work. He bade a mage relation construct this harp so its magic might disguise his utter lack of talent in the arts. Its power was greater than he had hoped, and he later turned to petty burglary using 'his' music to captivate his victims. Greagan ultimately disappeared some years ago amidst rumors of a bardic college uncharacteristically moved to violence. The harp still functions, though any self-respecting troubadour would reserve its use for the most dire of circumstances. The magic seems to be waning as well, and perhaps this is one item best lost to time.

The traveling adventurer could ask for no better a suit of armor in all the land.

Eminently practical, Bolhur demanded armor that would offer superior protection while hampering him in the least. By "hampering" he did not just mean in movement or weight, though this suit is just one-half the weight of normal plate mail: his ideal suit should also be able to withstand the rigors of his wanderings with little maintenance. This is not to say that Bolhur "Thunderaxe" neglected his armors (to say as such would get your ears boxed) but the regime of spit and polish required for a "gentleman's" suit was beyond his caring. Save the tassels and gilding of Full Plate for kings and heads of state; a working dwarf cares more for utility than looks.

@226=~This potion confers invisibility similar to the second level wizard spell of the same name, causing the imbiber to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the imbiber is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the imbiber detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or his gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the imbiber become visible. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the imbiber cancels it, until the imbbiber attacks any creature, until the imbiber's location is given away by manipulating objects or initiating dialog, or until 4 turns have passed. Thus the imbiber can move, open doors, talk if spoken to first, climb stairs, or drop items while remaining invisible. However, if the imbiber picks up objects, initiates dialog or attacks, the invisibility is broken, although the invisibility enables a surprise attack.

@257=~Ring of Fire Resistance: 'Batalista's Passport'
The grand mage Batalista intended this item to aid in his travels in the plane of fire, and it is said he repeatedly summoned a Salamander from that realm to aid in the construction. Not being known for their patience, it is likely he should not have pestered his "instructor" quite so much. The finger bearing the finished ring was indeed untouched by the inferno that claimed his tower. Had that finger still been attached, Batalista himself might have fared better.

This ring is not cumulative with other sources of fire resistance.

This ring and several of its type were originally crafted to protect the sons of King Castter De'wess, though who uttered the enchantment is unknown.

The Guard was an immortal sentry assigned to protect a tomb that sheltered the body of a princess of the Akanal.

Legend speaks of the diminutive Arla using this sling to place a well-sharpened pebble through the skull of a green dragon in mid-flight, though the same tale in another tavern places the stone squarely in the creature's hindquarters for more humorous than lethal effect.

@299=~Heavy Crossbow of Accuracy: 'The Guide'
A favored siege weapon of King Shastir Longeve, crossbows of this type were designed for the systematic removal of defensive forces thought safe behind the battlements of castles. Scant few of these weapons survive to this day, mainly due to the eventual annihilation of the king's forces by a coalition of subjugated lands. The enchantment on this heavy crossbow makes bolts launched from it fly far more accurately.

@302=~Light Crossbow of Speed: 'The Army Scythe'
A short-lived outpost of humans in the Frozen Forest unearthed this weapon, and many others, from the ruins of an ancient settlement deep within that cold land. Never knowing the names of their extinct benefactors, the colonists used these "tools" to carve a large territory for themselves, though in the end it was for naught. Crushed by a superior number of hobgoblins, these unfortunate souls have joined the ancients in their anonymity.

@305=~Amulet of Immunity to Charm~

@307=~Amulet of Immunity to Charm: 'Dryad-bane'
Many years ago there lived in the Snowflake Mountains in Amn an orc named Brashk. He was known for his exceptional size and strength but even more so for his hatred of the forests to the east and the dryads that lived therein. Through unknown means Brashk somehow got hold of this amulet and quickly discovered its power. He gathered hordes of orcs from nearby and launched large attacks on the dryads, their trees and all other woodland beings unfortunate enough to cross their paths. The orc army was in high spirits at the sight of a leader who would not fall victim to the magics of the dryads. However, to the doom of Brashk and his horde, the burning woods soon drew attention from elsewhere. A female ranger managed to gather several druids and even wood elves, and unite these for a short time to fight Brashk. This group was joined by other intelligent inhabitants of the woods that had not yet perished and together they put an end to the life of Brashk and nearly everyone with him. It is not known who became the new owner of the amulet and it has not been involved in actions as dramatic as those of the forest burning orc since.

@308=~Amulet of Magic Resistance~

@309=~Amulet of Magic Resistance: 'Wizard-guard'
This amulet was once in the possession of a horribly paranoid wizard from Cormyr. He was not a magic-user of great power but despite this he feared that other mages would seek his treasures and pry his secrets from his mind. It is highly unlikely that he created this item himself and he must have procured it elsewhere. There was never any need for it, however, as he did not have any treasures that the neighbouring wizards could not create themselves and they were all far ahead of him with regards to magical research. Quite ironically, the amulet failed to protect him when he attempted to create a magical barrier around his abode to shield off other wizards. His spell erred and caused the delicate magic to backfire, bringing his own house down on him. His corpse was later found in the ruins and the amulet was claimed by another who put it to better use.

Bows were either given longer staves or flexibility was increased with no change to the length. The former resulted in what is now called the long bow.

Many years ago, a warrior named Morrom won great fame when he and his group cleared an entire forest on the western borders of Cormyr, which was highly plagued by trolls. Morrom and his comrades slew many of the beasts in less than a day, and apparently struck such great fear into the remnants of the troll horde that they fled before the same fate would befall them. The secret to his success was his crimson bow that would set aflame any arrow that he fired from it. After having routed the monsters and recieved his reward, rumours quickly spread of his deed throughout the land. Some of these rumours reached the ears of others who desired to undertake equally epic quests, and after a failed assassination, Morrom was wise enough to realize that he either had to travel to another country where people had not heard of him or get rid of the bow. As he was quite fond of his newfound status in Cormyr, he decided to try to sell it or exchange it for something else. He did manage to trade it away, but the transaction was so secretive that it is still unknown who became the new owner or what Morrom was paid for it.

The bow was held by the city's champion, a true elven marksman, whose personal steed was a pegasus. Patrolling the valley's borders hundreds of feet into the air, he would rain endless waves of arrows down upon the unfortunate beasts that came too close to his realm. How it left him or what become of it afterwards is unknown.

@360=~Gloves of Thievery: 'Bailum's Curse'
The history of this pair of gloves is closely related to another magical item, the Ring of Damnation. The gloves were given to Bailum, a thief from Silverymoon, over 90 winters ago as a reward for an old spellbook he had recovered for a wizard in that city. During this mission Bailum had learned of the location of an old tomb in the area, and with the aid of his newfound gloves he set out to explore it. Bailum found a tomb with no guardians or treasures, except for a simple ring discovered in a hidden cache. He did not think much of it and intended to put it in his backpack but suddenly noticed that he had removed his gloves and put the ring on. The next thing he remembered was standing outside the house of the mage who had given him the gloves, pulling his sword from that mage's stomach. Bailum turned around, blood still dripping from the blade, and faced two approaching guards. As they had nearly reached him, two black bolts shot from the ring and both guards fell dead to the ground. An instant later Bailum found himself in an new location, the corpse of an old friend lying before him. In a similar fashion the presence of Bailum carved a path of destruction from the North down through the Sword Coast, following the tracks of Bailum's previous journeys. It all came to an end when Bailum reached Athkatla in Amn. The sudden death of a merchant in that city caught the attention of Cosmo, who permanently dispelled the magic of the ring and freed Bailum from its curse.

These gloves could have been worn by a dashing rogue who would wear them while seeking high adventure, charming young maidens and stealing from the wealthy and the noble - but this was not their fate. Instead they lay some fifty odd years on a shelf in a cold and wet dungeon with a lich for company. The undead mage was usually busy preparing this evil scheme or that cunning plan and did not provide much company. One day the place was finally breached by a group of righteous and noble-hearted adventurers who slew the lich and looted the place. For some odd reason the gloves were overlooked, however, and had to lie on that same shelf for another thirty years until a drunken kobold shaman who had lost his shoes came by and found them.

@409=~High Quality Warhammer~ 

@410=~Mounted knights cannot effectively use long pole weapons while on horseback, and as a result, many weapons have been fitted with shorter shafts so they may be wielded with just one hand. Maces and flails are two previous examples of this - the warhammer is another. The horseman's warhammer is the descendent of the Lucerne hammer. It is made entirely of steel, with rondels protecting and strengthening the grip. Rondels are small disks of metal, often shaped into decorative designs. The shaft is about 18 inches long.

@462=~Plate Mail of Haste +2: 'The Crimson Doom'
This magical armor is only a few years old but it has already seen countless battles. Many of these have been fought simply to wrench it from its owner, and none have possessed it for long as its trademark crimson metal easily gives the owner away to others who desire it. More often has the armor been splattered with the blood of the wearer than that of his or her opponents. The plate mail seems to have brought more havoc and woe than protection to those who carry it, but the armor itself has managed to survive the endless fights nonetheless.

@510=~Ring of Health: 'The Druid's Reward'
This ring was once in the possession of a young aspiring paladin named Soinyr, whose father had given it to him in the hope that Soinyr might gain an advantage over the other would-be knights. During one of the final tests given to him by his order, Sionyr came upon a forest that he had to travel through to reach his destination. Unfortunately, he quickly became lost and nightfall was not far off. Soon he found himself stumbling blindly through the undergrowth in the dark of the night, nearly panicing and without any knowledge of where he was heading. After having reached a blind end, he tried to go back but suddenly caught sight of a gigantic wolf only a few steps behind him. It was twice the size of any wolf he had ever seen before, and without hesitation he drew his sword and attacked it. The sword found its mark but the wound immediately enraged the beast and it let loose a mighty howl. In a matter of moments several other wolves appeared and they all slowly encircled him. Fearing his final moment to be upon him, Sionyr stood with his back against a tree and both hands on his sword, determined to kill as many of the wolves as possible before their teeth and claws would find their way through his armor. Just then, a stranger stepped into the circle of wolves from out of nowhere. The wolves calmed down with a wave of his hand and a few gentle words made them leave. The stranger then turned his attention on Soinyr who still stood with his sword in his hands, failing to believe what he had just witnessed. The man presented himself as Reol, druid of the forest, and told Soinyr to follow him, leading him all the way to the edge. Here he told Sionyr that if he intended to return to the forest he would like him to treat its inhabitants more according to their behaviour and less on prejudice. Soinyr realized the folly of his actions and felt that he had to repay the druid for his kindness. He then remembered his magical ring and, although he did not know what it did, he gave it to Reol in the hope that it might somehow aid him. Sionyr departed and Reol returned to his woods. The ring was later given to Reol's daughter who took it with her to other lands.

This ring was once used by a thief in Baldur's Gate who specialized in killing wizards. Upon entering the house of her victim she would expend a charge from the ring and become immune to their spells. It was then only a matter of finding and overwhelming the wizard. However, eventually she faced an opponent whose magic was too powerful to be stopped by her ring, and in less than a minute she fell dead to the floor. The wizard took the ring for himself and animated her corpse afterwards, so that she might help guard his house against future assassinations.

Siphuyrus, a wizard from Sigil, created this ring many years ago. He was very interested in the Quasielemental Plane of Lightning and this ring would protect him on his journeys there. Unfortunately, another wizard came to know of Siphuyrus' ring and wanted to possess it. He attempted to take it from Siphuyrus by force and in the magical battle between the two, a portal was somehow triggered and Siphuyrus fell through it. The portal took him to the world of Toril on the Prime Material Plane, to a place along the Sword Coast called the Fields of the Dead. As all his possessions were left in Sigil, Siphuyrus was unable to travel back to his home. He wandered this area for some time until he came upon a travelling alchemist who happened to have the needed component for his spell. Siphuyrus paid for it with this ring and the alchemist took it with him to Baldur's Gate where it passed onto another buyer.

This group included some highly regarded members of the church of Selûne, and while wars are common among the prists of the twin deities, the deaths of these priests drew the anger and attention of an unusually large group of Selûnite priests that soon gathered and set out to gain revenge. Their retaliation came swiftly and with fierce determination, and while Vindi's ring protected him from many of their spells, he and his fellow priests were soon overwhelmed and destroyed by the opposing force.

Vifrosd, a druid of the Spine of the World Mountains, is the first person known to possess this ring. He found it on a plateau north of the mountain range, a field littered with small frozen lakes. Here he came upon one lake in which the water was not frozen, and in fact, slightly warm to the touch. The water was clear and something in the middle of the lake caught his attention. A quick search revealed this ring lying on a stone at the bottom of the lake. He took it and stepped out of the water, just in time to hear it freeze behind him as he did so. Awed by its power, he quickly put it on and felt the numbing cold of the surrounding lands leave his body.

When casting this spell and laying his hand upon a creature, the priest causes 1-8 points of wound or other injury damage to the creature's body to be healed. This healing cannot affect creatures without corporeal bodies, nor can it cure wounds of creatures not living or of extraplanar origin. Curing is permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage; caused wounds will heal, or can be cured, just as any normal injury.~

Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 50-feet cube
Saving Throw: Negates effect

By means of this spell, the caster is able to cause plants in the area of effect to entangle creatures within the area. The grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about the creatures, holding them fast for the duration of the spell.

(Enchantment)

Level: 1
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By using this spell, the priest can temporarily enchant up to three small pepples, no larger than sling bullets. The magical stones can then be hurled at an opponent up to 30 yards away and all three can be thrown in one round. The character using them must roll normally to hit and will suffer a penalty to attack rolls if he if not proficient in the use of missile weapons. The stones are considered +1 weapons for determining if a creature can be struck (those struck only by magical weapons, for instance), although they do not have an attack or damage bonus. Each stone that hits inflicts 1D4 points of damage (1D4+2 points against undead). The magic in each stone lasts only for half an hour, or until used.~

Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds/level

Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1

(Abjuration)

Level: 1
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

When the priest casts a Sanctuary spell, it causes all of his opponents to ignore the protected creature's existence; as if he is invisible. While protected by this spell, the subject cannot take direct offensive action without breaking the spell, but may use non-attack spells or otherwise act in any way that does not violate the prohibition against offensive action. This allows a warded priest to heal wounds, for example, or to Bless himself. He cannot cast spells on other creatures without ending the spell.~

Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4

Saving Throw: Negates effect

This spell creates a brilliant ray of scorching heat that slants down from the sky to strike one target of the caster's choice. The victim is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the ray - a successful save indicates that it missed altogether.

Duration: 4 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 50-feet cube

The recipient of this spell gains the benefit of a Bless spell (+ 1 to attack rolls) and a special bonus of 1D8 additional hit points for the duration of the spell.

Range: Touch
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When a priest casts the Barkskin spell upon a creature, its skin becomes as tough as bark, increasing its base Armor Class to AC 6, plus 1 AC for every four levels of the priest: Armor Class 5 at 4th level, Armor Class 4 at 8th, and so on. In addition, saving throw rolls vs. all attack forms except magic gain a +1 bonus. This spell can be placed on the caster or on any other creature he touches.~ 

@555=~Chant~ 

@556=~Chant 
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 2
Sphere: All
Range: 0
Duration: Time of chanting
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 50-foot cube
Saving Throw: None

By means of the Chant spell, the priest brings special favor upon himself and his party, and causes harm to his enemies. When the Chant spell is completed, all attack and damage rolls and saving throws made by those in the area of effect who are friendly to the priest gain +1 bonuses, while those of the enemies suffer -1 penalties. This bonus/penalty continues as long as the caster continues to chant the mystic syllables and is stationary. However, an interruption (such as an attack that succeeds and causes damage, or a Silence spell) breaks the spell. Multiple chants are not cumulative.~ 

@557=~Charm Person or Mammal~ 

@558=~Charm Person or Mammal 
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 2
Sphere: Animal
Range: 80 yards
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 person or mammal
Saving Throw: Negates effect

This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. If the spell recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give him orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible. If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the charm spell is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence.~

@559=~Find Traps~ 

@560=~Find Traps 
(Divination)

Level: 2
Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When a priest casts a Find Traps spell, all traps, whether concealed normally or magically, of magical or mechanical nature become apparent. A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden or unexpected result, the spellcaster would view the result as undesirable or harmful, and the creator specifically intended the harmful or undesirable result as such. Thus traps include glyphs, and similar spells or devices. Due to the nature of the spell, the caster must stop to concentrate once per round which will effectively interrupt any action. This, however, will not affect spellcasting.~

@561=~Flame Blade~ 

@562=~Flame Blade 
(Evocation)

Level: 2
Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: 0
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 3-feet long blade
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster causes a blazing ray of red-hot fire to spring forth from his hand. This blade-like ray is wielded as if it were a scimitar. If the caster successfully hits with the flame blade in melee combat, the creature struck suffers 1D4 + 4 points of damage, with a damage bonus of +2 if the creature is undead. However, it is not a magical weapon in the normal sense of the term, so creatures struck only by magical weapons are not harmed by it.~ 

@563=~Goodberry~

(Evocation)

Level: 2
Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent

Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1D4 persons within 5 feet
Saving Throw: Negates effect

This spell holds a single human, demihuman, or humanoid creature rigidly immobile and in place for five or more rounds. The Hold Person spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of mansize or smaller, including dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also effected. Those who succeed on their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.~

@567=~Know Alignment~ 

@568=~Know Alignment 
(Divination)

Level: 2
Sphere: Divination
Range: 10 yards
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates effect

A Know Alignment spell enables the priest to exactly read the aura of a creature. The caster must remain stationary and concentrate on the subject for a full round. If the creature rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell, the caster learns nothing about that particular creature from the casting. Certain magical devices negate the power of the Know Alignment spell.~

(Alteration)

Level: 2
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is placed upon a creature by a priest, the creature's body is toughened to withstand heat and cold. The recipient can somewhat resist intense heat or cold (whether natural or magical in origin), such as red-hot charcoal, a large amount of burning oil, flaming swords, Fireballs, Burning Hands, or wands of frost. In all of these cases, the temperature affects the creature to some extent. The recipient has all damage sustained by fire or cold reduced by 25%. This spell is not cumulative with itself or other sources of fire or cold resistance.~

Range: 120 yards
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 50-feet cube
Saving Throw: Negates effect

Upon casting this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: conversation is impossible and spells cannot be cast unless an affected spellcaster then casts Vocalize. Each creature in the area must make a saving throw vs. spells; if the save is failed then they are silenced for the duration of the spell. Note that this spell does not continue to affect the area after being cast; only those in the area at the time of the casting are affected by the silence.~

Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By calling upon his deity, the caster of a Spiritual Hammer spell brings into existence a field of force shaped vaguely like a hammer. As long as the caster concentrates upon the hammer, it strikes at any opponent within its range, as desired. In addition, it strikes as a magical weapon with a bonus of +1 for every six experience levels (or fraction) of the spellcaster, up to a total of +3 to the attack roll and +3 to the damage roll for a 13th-level caster. The base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal warhammer: 1D4 + 1 plus the magical bonus.~

(Invocation)

Level: 2
Sphere: Summoning
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the priest's body shudders and glows with a shimmering aura as it becomes a vessel for the power of his god. When he does this his strength, dexterity and constitution scores are raised by 1 point for every 3 levels of the caster. A third level caster would have his scores raised by 1, a sixth level caster would have his scores raised by 2 and a ninth level caster would have his scores raised by 3. When the spell ends, the energy abruptly leaves the priest's body, leaving him physically and mentally drained and in need of rest.~ 

@579=~Cure Moderate Wounds~ 

@580=~Cure Moderate Wounds 
(Necromancy)

Level: 2
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

Somewhat less common than the well-known Cure Light Wounds and Cure Serious Wounds, this healing spell was created by a priest who found that his heroic companions required his skills at doctoring more than his advice and wisdom. By laying his hands on the subject's body, the priest can heal 1D10+1 points of damage.~ 

@581=~Resist Acid and Corrosion~ 

@582=~Resist Acid and Corrosion 
(Abjuration)

Level: 2
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell provides a subject with a better resistance to acid, corrosives, and casustic substances of all kinds. Mild corrosives cannot harm the subject at all. More intense acids and corrosives (black dragon breath, Melf's Acid Arrow, and the natural attacks of various slimes and jellies) inflict only the half normal damage on the protected character. This spell is not cumulative with itself or other sources of acid resistance.~ 

@583=~Animate Dead~ 

@584=~Animate Dead 
(Necromancy)

Level: 3
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: 10 yards
Duration: 1 day
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates the lowest of the undead monsters: skeletons and zombies, usually from the bones of dead humans, demihumans, or humanoids. The spell causes these remains to become animated and obey the simple telepathic commands of the caster, regardless of how they communicated in life. They will not responds to verbal or magical commands from enemies, making them immune to mind-control magics such as Charm or Domination, and as well, having no eyes, flesh, internal organs or cardiopulmonary systems, are immune to poison and petrification. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat, 24 hours pass, or are turned; the magic cannot be dispelled. The priest can animate one skeleton for each experience level he has attained.~ 

@585=~Call Lightning~ 

@586=~Call Lightning 
(Alteration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Weather
Range: 360 yards
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

When a Call Lightning spell is cast, it must be cast outside, otherwise it will not work and the spell is wasted. The caster can call down one bolt every three rounds. The spell has a duration of three rounds per caster level, to a maximum of 18 rounds. Each bolt causes 2D8 points of electrical damage, plus an additional 1D8 points for each of the caster's experience levels. Thus, a 4th-level caster calls down a 6D8 bolt (2D8 + 4D8). The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at any of the priest's enemies. The caster does not choose the targets of the spell, though the lighting will not strike any of his allies.~

(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Sphere: All
Range: 60 yards
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 50-feet cube
Saving Throw: None

When a wizard casts this spell, it has a chance to neutralize or negate magic it comes in contact with. First, it removes spells and spell-like effects (including device effects and innate abilities) from creatures or objects. Second, it disrupts the casting or use of these in the area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. The chance to dispel depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance is 50%. If the caster is of higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the chance increases by 5% per level. If the caster is of lower level, the chance decreases by 10% per level. There is always 1% chance that the dispel succeeds or fails.~

(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Guardian
Range: 60 yards
Duration: Permanent until discharged
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 15-feet cube
Saving Throw: Negates effect

A Glyph of Warding is a powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent unauthorized or hostile creatures from passing, entering, or opening. Any creature violating the warded area is subject to the magic it stores. A successful saving throw vs. spell enables the creature to escape the effects of the glyph. When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. When the glyph is activated, it deals 1D4 points of electrical damage per level of the caster to the victim.~

If the victim is touched, a saving throw is still applicable; if it is successful, the effect is negated. Note that upon casting the spell, the priest has one round to attempt to hit his intended victim. If the duration expires the magic is lost.~

It can only be injured by magical weapons and can strike monsters hit only by +1 or better weapons.

(Alteration)

Sphere: Law
Range: 40 yards
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the priest effectively draws on the strength of his god and lends it to the target creature, in effect creating a champion. The target gains a bonus to his THAC0 at a rate of 1 for every 3 levels of the caster. So a 9th level priest would confer a THAC0 bonus of 3 to the target, and so on. Also the target's strength is set to 18/00 for the duration of the spell, and all the bonuses to hit and damage that this strength confers. The drawback to this is that the priest must concentrate on the connection between the target and his god for the duration of the spell, hence losing the ability to cast any spells during this time. The effect lasts for 3 rounds for every level of the caster or until dispelled.~

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a topaz that glows with an inner light. The gem must be immediatly thrown at an opponent, for it quickly becomes too hot to hold. The stone can be hurled up to 30 yards. The priest gains a +3 bonus to his attack roll and suffers no penalty for non-proficiency. In addition, the glowing gem is considered a +3 weapon for determining whether a creature can be struck (creatures hit only by magical weapons, for example). There is no damage bonus, however. When it hits, the gem bursts with a brilliant, searing flash that causes 6D6 points of fire damage to the target and blinds him for 3 rounds. The victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell.

Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the spell recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give him orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible. If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the charm spell is broken.

A Spook spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears to cause the target creature to percieve the spellcaster as someone or something inimical.

If the creature does not succeed a saving throw vs. spell, it turns and flees at maximum speed as far from the wizard as possible, though items carried are not dropped. The creature has a saving throw penalty of -1 for every two experience levels of the caster, to a maximum of -6 at 12th level.

Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When a Blur spell is cast, the wizard causes the outline of his form to become blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion causes all attacks against the caster to be made with a -4 penalty on the first round and with -2 penalties thereafter. It also grants the wizard a +1 bonus to his saving throw for any direct magical attack. A Detect Invisibility spell will not counter this effect.~

Saving Throw: None

When the wizard casts a Detect Invisibility spell, he is able to see clearly any objects or beings that are invisible.

@714=~Invisibility 
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 2
Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or his gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the recipient attacks any creature, until the wizard's location is given away by manipulating objects or initiating dialog, or until 24 hours have passed. Thus the invisible being can move, open doors, talk if spoken to first, climb stairs, or drop items while remaining invisible. However, if the invisible being picks up objects, initiates dialog or attacks, the Invisibility is broken, although the Invisibility enables a surprise attack.~

(Divination)

Level: 2
Range: 10 yards
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates effect

A Know Alignment spell enables the mage to exactly read the aura of a creature. If the creature rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell, the caster learns nothing about that particular creature from the casting. When a character is hit by this spell, he will glow red if he's evil, blue if he's good, and white if he's neutral.~

@721=~Melf's Acid Arrow~ 

@722=~Melf's Acid Arrow 
(Conjuration)

Level: 2
Range: 180 yards
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 target
Saving Throw: Special

By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical arrow that speeds to its target as if fired from the bow of a fighter of the same level as the wizard. No modifiers for non-proficiency, or specialization are used. The arrow has no attack or damage bonus, but it inflicts 2D4 points of acid damage. For every three levels that the caster has achieved, the acid, unless somehow neutralized, lasts for another round, inflicting another 2D4 points of damage each round. So at 3rd-5th level, the acid lasts two rounds; at 6th-8th level, the acid lasts for three rounds, etc. Note that upon casting the spell, the wizard has one round to attempt to hit his intended victim. If the duration expires or he misses his target, the magic is lost.~ 

@723=~Mirror Image~ 

@724=~Mirror Image 
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When a Mirror Image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes from two to eight exact duplicates of himself to come into being around him. These images do exactly what the wizard does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until struck. The images seem to shift from round to round, so that an enemy must first hit every image before being able to hit the wizard. The number of Mirror Images the wizard creates is equal to 1D4 plus 1 for every three levels of experience he has achieved, to a maximum of eight images.~

A Web spell creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. The Web spell covers a maximum area of about 50 feet in radius. Creatures caught within Webs, or simply touching them, become stuck among the gluey fibers. Anyone in the area when the spell is cast must roll a saving throw vs. spell with a -2 penalty. If the saving throw is successful, then the creature is free to move out of the area. A failed saving throw means the creature is stuck in the Webs unable to move. Each round that a creature remains in the Web, he must make a saving throw or be unable to move.~

This spell sets the subject's Dexterity score to 16, 17 or 18 with an equal chance of each result.~

(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Range: 120 yards
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 50-feet cube
Saving Throw: None

When a wizard casts this spell, it has a chance to neutralize or negate magic it comes in contact with. First, it removes spells and spell-like effects (including device effects and innate abilities) from creatures or objects. Second, it disrupts the casting or use of these in the area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. The chance to dispel depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance is 50%. If the caster is of higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the chance increases by 5% per level. If the caster is of lower level, the chance decreases by 10% per level. There is always 1% chance that the dispel succeeds or fails.~

This spell allows the wizard to surround himself with a portion of his own life essence, which takes the form of a shimmering aura. The Spirit Armor offers protection equivalent to splint mail (AC 4) and grants the wizard a +3 bonus to saving throws vs. magical attacks. The Spirit Armor's effects are not cumulative with other types of armor, but Dexterity bonuses apply. It does not hinder movement or add weight or encumberance. It does not interfere with spellcasting. When the spell ends, the aura dissipates and the caster temporarily loses a bit of his life essence, suffering 2D3 points of damage unless he succeeds at a saving throw vs. spell. No damage is sustained if the save is successful.~

@804=~Polymorph Other 
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: 5 yards/level
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates effect

The Polymorph other spell is a powerful magic that permanently alters the form of the creature affected. Mental attributes are not affected, and the target does not receive the special abilities of the new form. However all physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form. This is a specific version of the spell in that the recipient will be transformed into a squirrel unless a save vs. petrification/polymorph is made successfully. The transformation is instant and permanent until a Dispel Magic is cast successfully upon the affected creature. The natural attacks of the new form also become available and all clothes and equipment that the target was wearing will mold into the new form.~

@806=~Polymorph Self 
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to assume the form of another creature. This spell does not give the new form's other abilities such as special attacks and magic, nor does it run the risk of the wizard changing personality and mentality. When the spell is cast, for the duration of the spell the caster may transform into any of the new forms at any time, and as many times as he wishes. The caster gains the natural attacks of the new form in some cases and may use weapons in others. The mental attributes of the wizard remain the same, however all the physical attributes are attained from the new form.~

(Abjuration)

Level: 4

Area of Effect: 1 creature

If the victim is touched, a saving throw is still applicable; if it is successful, the effect is negated. Note that upon casting the spell, the wizard has one round to attempt to hit his intended victim. If the duration expires the magic is lost.~

@812=~Turn Pebble to Boulder 
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

At the culmination of this spell, the caster hurls a pebble which grows and increases in speed, becoming a deadly boulder that inflicts 3D6+8 points of damage if it strikes the target. That caster's THAC0 is used to determine success, and the caster is considered to be proficient with the thrown pebble. The maximum range of attack is equal to 30 yards. Only the caster may throw the pebble. The wizard can enchant one stone at 7th level and gains one stone per three levels of experience thereafter (two stones at 10th level, three at 13th level, etc). Only one pebble may be thrown per round. The spell has a duration in rounds equal to the number of pebbles enchanted. Each pebble requires a seperate attack roll. Pebbles may be thrown at different targets within range.~

@816=~Improved Strength 
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

By casting this spell, the wizard can empower a creature with superhuman strength. Unlike the 2nd-level Strength spell, Improved Strength allows the recipient of the spell to ignore race or class restrictions on his maximum Strength score. The strength gained is 21, 22 or 23 with an equal chance of each result. This spell is cumulative with other sources that add to strength. When the spell ends, the recipient is struck by intense fatigue.~ 

@817=~Mordenkainen's Force Missiles~ 

@818=~Mordenkainen's Force Missiles 
(Invocation/Evocation)

Level: 4
Range: 30 yards + 10 yards/level
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 target
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a brilliant globe of magical energy that streaks forth from the caster's hand to unerringly strike its target, much like a Magic Missile spell. The wizard creates one missile at 7th level and an additional missile at every third level after 7th-in other words, two missiles at 10th level, three at 13th, and so on, to a maximum of seven missiles at 25th level. Each missile inflicts 2D4 points of damage to the target and then bursts in a 1-foot radius concussive blast that inflicts 1 point of damage per level of the caster-for example, a 12th-level wizard could conjure two Force Missiles, each of which strikes for 2D4+12 points of damage. The victim may attempt a saving throw vs. spell to negate the consussion damage, but the impact of the missile itself allows no saving throw.~ 

@819=~Animate Dead~ 

@820=~Animate Dead 
(Necromancy)

Level: 5
Range: 10 yards
Duration: 1 day
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates the lowest of the undead monsters: skeletons and zombies, usually from the bones of dead humans, demihumans, or humanoids. The spell causes these remains to become animated and obey the simple telepathic commands of the caster, regardless of how they communicated in life. They will not responds to verbal or magical commands from enemies, making them immune to mind-control magics such as Charm or Domination, and as well, having no eyes, flesh, internal organs or cardiopulmonary systems, are immune to poison and petrification. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat, 24 hours pass, or are turned; the magic cannot be dispelled. The wizard can animate one skeleton for each experience level he has attained, or one zombie for every two levels.~ 

@821=~Cloudkill~ 

@822=~Cloudkill 
(Evocation)

Level: 5
Range: 10 yards
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30' x 30' cloud
Saving Throw: None

This spell generates a billowing cloud of ghastly yellowish green vapors that is so toxic as to slay any creature with fewer than 4 Hit Dice, cause creatures with 4 to 5 Hit Dice to roll saving throws vs. poison with -4 penalties or be slain, and creatures with 6 Hit Dice to roll unmodified saving throws vs. poison or be slain. Holding one's breath has no effect on the lethality of the spell. Those above 6th level must leave the cloud immediately or suffer 1D10 points of poison damage each round while in the area of effect.~ 

@823=~Cone of Cold~ 

@824=~Cone of Cold 
(Evocation)

Level: 5
Range: 10 yards
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

When this spell is cast, it causes a cone-shaped area of extreme cold, originating at the wizard's hand and extending outward in a cone thirty feet long and ten feet in diameter. It drains heat and causes 1D4 + 1 points of damage per level of experience of the wizard. For example, a 10th-level wizard would cast a cone of cold causing 10D4 + 10 points of damage.~ 

@825=~Monster Summoning III~ 

@826=~Monster Summoning III 
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 5
Range: 40 yards
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is much like the 3rd-level Monster Summoning I spell, except that this spell summons 1D4 3rd-level monsters. These appear within spell range and attack the caster's opponents, until the spell duration expires, or the monsters are slain. The monsters will obey simple telepathic commands, but will not follow the caster out of the area that they were summoned in.~ 

@827=~Shadow Door~ 

@828=~Shadow Door 
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the wizard creates the illusion of a door. The illusion also permits the wizard to appear to step through this "door" and disappear.

A Detect Invisibility/Invisibility Purge spell, or similar magical means can discover the wizard.~ 

@829=~Domination~ 

@830=~Domination 
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 5
Range: 10 yards/level
Duration: 10 turns
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates effect

The Domination spell enables the caster to control the actions of any creature while the spell is in effect. This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victim. Unlike the 4th level priest spell Mental Domination, the target has no option for release, even if made to do something against his morals, except of course a Dispel Magic. The target gets a saving throw vs. spell at -2 in order to avoid the effect.~ 

@831=~Hold Monster~

Undead creatures cannot be held.~

(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 5
Range: 5 yards/level
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 50-feet cube
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is similar to the 4th-level Confusion spell, but only creatures with more levels or Hit Dice than the caster's level recieve a saving throw. Those allowed saving throws roll them vs. spell with -2 penalties. Those who successfully save are unaffected by the spell. Affected creatures wander away, stand confused or attack the nearest creature. The spell lasts one round for each level of the caster.~

@838=~Invulnerability to Normal Weapons 
(Abjuration)

Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a invisible, mobile, magical sphere around the caster that cannot be penetrated by non-magical blunt weapons, edged weapons, or missile weapons.

When man mastered metals, spearheads were made from iron and steel.

@855=~These swords are usually referred to as doubled-edged swords, war swords, or military swords. In many cases, the long sword has a single-edged blade. There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture, and may vary within the same culture depending on the era. Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from 35 inches to 47 inches. In the latter case, the blade is known to take up 40 inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip. Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.

However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting.

Where as the sabre was intended mainly for horsemen, mainly due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence. The "shamshir", as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point. The effect of this is that it is slightly slower but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat.

This sword is but one of many items enchanted by Arbane the Mighty. Despite his immense magical powers, he hated putting himself at risk and often hired adventures to perform tasks for him. This sword was made for a warrior who was to retrieve a book for Arbane which was guarded by many creatures with paralytic abilities. The warrior did not honor the contract, however, and decided to keep the sword for himself and seek his fortune elsewhere. When the warrior did not return with the book Arbane grew suspecious and tracked him down by divining the sword's location. Arbane did not bother listening to any excuses and exacted his vengeance swiftly. He polymorphed the warrior into a horse and rode it to death.

@862=~Short Sword +1, +4 vs. undead~ 

@863=~Short Sword +1, +4 vs. undead: 'Blackflame'
This sword has a long history of slaying undead. Countless skeletons, zombies, ghouls and ghasts, and even greater undead such as skeleton warriors, have fallen before its wielders. During one particular event its magic did little to even the odds against the enemy, however. In early Marpenoth 1349 DR Obran the Odd, a devout priest of Lathandar, gathered a small horde of fanatical followers he had gained over the years and assaulted Warlock's Crypt, the stronghold of Larloch the Lich. Warlock's Crypt is normally a place the people of the Sword Coast dare not come within 50 miles of, or even speak loudly of, lest they gain the attention of Larloch, but Obran's hatred of the undead knew no bounds and he saw Warlock's Crypt as the ultimate blight upon the face of Faerûn. It certainly holds the greatest collection of ultra-powerful undead and Obran's small army was only starting to get close to the place when darkness and death descended upon them. Blackflame was wielded by a human battlemage that day whose judgement was not nearly as clouded as that of his comrades. After the initial turmoil and confusion had settled he saw Obran coming towards him with the dead, empty stare and hungry snarl of an undead being, and knew they were facing impossible odds. He teleported away from the battlefield and counted himself lucky for being alive. He threw away the sword and abandoned adventuring from that day on.

Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.

During a fierce battle between a human cavalry division and a hobgoblin horde, the young man was sent for reinforcements. He was beset by a cascade of arrows that nearly blocked out the sun, and he knew that even if he avoided the arrows himself, should his horse fall he would surely be doomed. With his shield and body he positioned himself to take the brunt of the onslaught, and was mortally wounded for it. His horse remained unscathed allowing for their escape, and his body was carried back to the nearest town, where he was resurrected from death.

Upon hearing that a red dragon was ravaging the countryside, Pellan mounted his horse and rode off to do battle. Pellan and his armor digested readily but the shield gave the dragon severe stomach cramps. He coughed it up and it lay in his treasure pile for several years until it was retrieved by Pellan's son, a paladin who knew when to sneak.

@927=~An interesting piece o' material you got there.  Ankheg if I'm not mistaken?  Been a while since I seen the like, but if I remember correctly, it makes a fine set of armor.  If properly treated it's comparable to field plate with half the weight!  If you're willing to part with your shell I'll give you 500 gold for it.  No more can I offer with business as slow as it is.  Iron shortage hurting us all.~

@928=~Suit yourself. I'll be here if you change your mind.~

@929=~Taerom "Thunderhammer" has offered to buy the Anhkeg shell I found for 500 gold!~

@938=~I noticed that you only have one full plate mail. Could you make another one?~

@939=~Well... I suppose I could but 'cause of the iron crisis it is going to cost you a lot of gold.  Thalantyr has helped me keep a small reserve of iron that has not gone bad and there should be just enough to make a full plate mail out of it.  But since this means using all I have got, I want 15000 gold for it.~

@940=~15000!!  I refuse to pay that much for a suit of armor!~

@941=~I am afraid I do not have that much gold right now.  I will return when I have aquired some more.~

The katana is perhaps one of the finest swords ever made, the steps to its creation a long and secret process, that is more art form than anything else.  This blade is an important facet of Kara-Tur culture.  To touch or wield a samurai's katana is to insult the samurai and to incite his wrath.  For a gaijin, or foreigner, to own such a blade is a rare occurrence. Either the gaijin is a greatly honored friend of an important minister, or the gaijin has murdered a samurai.

@982=~To enchant a katana is no simple process.  Unlike conventional weapons, the katana is already a near-perfect fighting sword.  To improve it usually requires a sacrifice, perhaps a dying samurai might beg a Wu Jen to infuse his fighting spirit into the spirit of the katana.  The wielder of an enchanted katana, such as this one, must respect the customs of Kara-Tur and of the samurai who once carried this blade into battle.  Not doing so could drastically change one's luck for the worse.

Range: 30 yards
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell causes a major disease and weakness in a creature. The afflicted individual is immediately stricken with painful and distracting symptoms: boils, blotches, lesions, seeping abscesses, and so on. Strength, Dexterity, and Charisma are reduced by 2. Attack rolls are decreased by 2. The effect persists until the character receives a Cure Disease spell.~

@1025=~Spider Spawn
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 4
Range: 60 yards
Duration: 6 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell calls 1 Hit Die of spiders per two levels of the caster. The spiders may have from 1+1 HD to 4+4 HD each. Thus, a 12th-level caster could summon six 1+1 HD spiders, three 2+2 HD spiders, and so on. The spell brings the nearest spiders, so if multiple spiders are summoned, they may be of various types. The arachnids appear within spell range and attack creatures indicated by the caster until the spell expires, or they are slain. The spiders never check morale.~

@1026=~Large Spider~

@1027=~Wizard Eye
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is employed, the wizard creates an invisible sensory organ that sends him visual information. The Wizard Eye can see with normal vision up to 60 ft. away in brightly lit areas, and can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a Detect Invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of a Wizard Eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful Dispel Magic spell cast on the wizard or the eye ends the spell.~

@1028=~Spell Immunity
(Abjuration)

Level: 5
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the wizard renders a creature touched immune to the effects of a specific spell of 4th level or less. It protects against the spell in all its forms, including the innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It does not protect against breath weapons or gaze attacks of any type. Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a certain sphere of spells or a group of spells that are similar in effect.~

(Abjuration)

Level: 5
Range: Touch
Duration: 5 rounds/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

The protected creature receives 50% resistance to any electrical attack, natural or magical.~

@1094=~Lower Resistance
(Abjuration, Alteration)

Level: 5
Range: 60 yards
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Using this spell, a wizard can attempt to reduce the magic resistance of a target creature. The magic resistance of the subject works against the Lower Resistance spell itself, but at 20% below its normal value. No saving throw is permitted in addition to magic resistance. A target creature that does not resist the effects of the spell has its magic resistance reduced by a base 16% plus 1% per level of the caster (that is, a base 25% reduction at 9th level).~

@1095=~Magic Resistance Lowered~

@1096=~Conjure Elemental~

@1097=~Conjure Elemental
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 5
Range: 60 yards
Duration: 5 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Summons 1 elemental
Saving Throw: None

There are actually three spells in the Conjure Elemental spell. The wizard is able to conjure an air, earth, or fire elemental with this spell. Conjured elementals have 8 HD. The conjured elemental must be controlled by the wizard - the spellcaster must concentrate on the elemental doing his commands - or it turns on the wizard and attacks. If the wizard is wounded, his concentration is broken. There is always a 2% chance that the elemental turns on its conjurer regardless of conjuration. This check is made at the end of the second and each succeeding round.
Note: the spellcaster may choose to stop concentrating via the special abilities menu.~

@1098=~Fire Elemental~

@1099=~Air Elemental~

@1100=~Earth Elemental~

@1101=~Concentration ended~

@1102=~End concentration~

@1103=~Protection From Acid
(Abjuration)

Level: 5
Range: Touch
Duration: 5 rounds/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell protects the creature from all forms of acid, reducing acid damage by 50%.~

@1104=~Phantom Blade
(Evocation)

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a translucent, shadowlike, weightless area of magical force extending from the fingers of one of the caster's hands. This silent construct is blade-shaped. Its cutting edges inflict damage just as do those of a real sword. The caster wields the Phantom Blade as if proficient in the use of this weapon, at <PRO_HISHER> normal THAC0. 
A Phantom Blade counts as a +2 magical sword for purposes of what it can hit (though it does not gain this attack or damage bonus). Against living foes, it cuts for 1d10 points of damage per successful strike. Against undead creatures, it gives a +4 bonus to the wielder's attack roll and causes 4d4 points of damage.~

@1105=~Minor Spell Turning
(Abjuration)

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the 7th-level Spell Turning, which causes spells cast against the wizard to rebound upon the original caster. This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the protected wizard, spell effects delivered by touch, and spell effects from devices such as wands, staves, and so forth. Thus, a Blindness spell cast at the protected wizard could be turned back upon and possibly blind the caster.
One to four (1d4) spell levels can be turned, but the player never knows how effective the spell is. However, as long as one spell level remains a spell will be turned. Spells of 4th level or above cannot be turned.~

@1106=~Sunfire
(Evocation)

Level: 5
Range: 50 yards
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Sphere with 20-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell creates a deadly and explosive ball of flame, said to be harnessed from the sun. Damage equals those of a fireball: it causes 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster, up to a maximum of 12d6. Creatures within the radius of the sphere suffer only half damage if they make a saving throw vs. spell. Yet, there is one key difference between this spell and a Fireball. The wizard who casts Sunfire is immune to the spell effects. The caster can even center the spell on himself and still escape harm.~

@1107=~HUMANS: Humans are the predominant race in Faerûn. Humans rule most of the significant empires and kingdoms in the Forgotten Realms. They are the most social and tolerant of races, excepting perhaps the halflings. Humans may advance as any class and are also the only race that can dual-class. Humans may not multi-class.~

@1108=~DWARVES: Dwarves are short and stocky, easily identifiable by their size and shape. They have ruddy cheeks, dark eyes, and dark hair. Dwarves tend to be dour and taciturn. They are given to hard work, and care little for most humor. They enjoy beer, ale, mead, but most of all, they love gold. There are four racial divisions of dwarves within the Realms: shield dwarves, gold dwarves, wild dwarves, and duergar.

Dwarves have the following traits:
– +2 bonus to Saving Throws vs. Paralysis/Poison/Death, vs. Rod/Staff/Wand, and vs. Spell, with additional bonuses based on Constitution.
– Infravision.
- Cannot use large weapons or large shields
- +1 THAC0 bonus against hobgoblins
- Ogres and ogre-mages suffer a -4 penalty to hit dwarves. Half-ogres are at -2 to hit.
– +10% Open Locks, +15% Find/Remove Traps, +5% Detect Illusion.
– +1 Constitution, –1 Dexterity, –2 Charisma.~

@1109=~ELVES: Elves tend to be shorter and slimmer than humans. Their features are finely chiseled and delicate, and they speak in melodic tones. Elves are looked upon as being frivolous and aloof. They concern themselves with natural beauty, dancing, frolicking, and other similar pursuits. Their humor is clever, as are their songs and poetry. There are six racial divisions of elves within the Realms: gold elves, moon elves, wild elves, sea elves, dark elves (drow), and winged elves (avariel).

Elves have the following traits:
– 90% resistance against charm and sleep magics.
– Infravision.
– +1 THAC0 bonus with bows, short swords, and long swords.
– +5% Pick Pockets, -5% Open Locks, +5% Move Silently, +10% Hide In Shadows.
– +1 Dexterity, –1 Constitution.~

@1110=~GNOMES: Kin to dwarves, gnomes are noticeably smaller than their distant cousins. Gnomes, as they proudly maintain, are also less rotund than dwarves. Most have dark tan or brown skin, white hair, and rather large noses. Gnomes have lively and sly senses of humor, especially for practical jokes. They have a love for nature that is only matched by their love for gems and jewelry. There are two racial divisions of gnomes within the Realms: rock gnomes and deep gnomes (svirfneblin).

Gnomes have the following traits:
– +2 bonus to Saving Throws vs. Rod/Staff/Wand and vs. Spell, with additional bonuses based on Constitution.
– Infravision.
- Cannot use large weapons, large shields or medium shields
- +1 THAC0 bonus against kobolds
- Gnolls, ogres, ogre mages and half-ogres suffer a -4 penalty to hit gnomes.
- +5% Open Locks, +10% Find/Remove Traps, +5% Move Silently, +5% Hide In Shadows, +10% Detect Illusion.
– +1 Intelligence, -1 Wisdom.~

@1111=~HALFLINGS: Halflings are short, generally plump people, very much like small humans. Their faces are round and broad, and often quite florid. Their hair is typically curly, and the tops of their feet are covered with coarse hair. Overall they prefer the comforts of home to dangerous adventuring. They enjoy good living, rough humor, and homespun tales. There are three racial divisions of halflings within the Realms: the hairfoot, tallfellow, and stout.

Halflings have the following traits:
– +2 bonus to Saving Throws vs. Paralysis/Poison/Death, vs. Rod/Staff/Wand, and vs. Spell, with additional bonuses based on Constitution.
- Cannot use large weapons, large shields or medium shields.
– +1 THAC0 bonus with slings, darts, throwing daggers and throwing axes.
- +5% Pick Pockets, +5% Open Locks, +5% Find/Remove Traps, +10% Move Silently, +15% Hide In Shadows.
– +1 Dexterity, –1 Strength, –1 Wisdom.~

@1112=~HALF-ELVES: Half-elves are a mix of human and elven blood. They are handsome folk, with good features from each of their parent races. A half-elf has the curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition of their human ancestors and the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of their elven ancestors.

Half-elves have the following traits:
– 30% resistance against charm and sleep magics.
– Infravision.
- +10% Pick Pockets, +5% Hide In Shadows, +5% Detect Illusion.~

@1113=~HALF-ORCS: Half-orcs are born from the union of human and orc parents. They are as tall as humans, but a little heavier due to their muscular builds. Their greenish pigmentation, sloping forehead, jutting jaw, prominent teeth, and coarse body hair make their lineage plain for all to see. In the Sword Coast, half-orcs are tolerated, as unlike in the north the local people haven't had centuries of warfare with orc kind. Half-orcs are known for their great strength.

Half-orcs have the following traits:
- +5% Find/Remove Traps, -5% Detect Illusion.
– +1 Strength, +1 Constitution, -2 Intelligence.~

@1114=~THIEF: To accomplish <PRO_HISHER> goals, for good or ill, the Thief is a skilled pilferer. Cunning, nimbleness, and stealth are <PRO_HISHER> hallmarks. Whether <PRO_HESHE> turns <PRO_HISHER> talent against innocent passersby and wealthy merchants or oppressors and monsters is a choice for the Thief to make.
